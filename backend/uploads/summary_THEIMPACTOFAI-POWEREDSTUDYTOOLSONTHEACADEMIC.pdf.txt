As such, the purpose of this paper is to fill in this research gap, by attempting to bring a new understanding of how AI-powered study tools might influence the academic performance of higher education students (Boubker, 2024). Research Aim This research study aims to explore the impact of AI-powered study tools on the academic performance and motivation of higher education students. The researchers aim to examine the impact of the use of artificial intelligence (AI) powered study tools and higher education students’ motivation towards AI on academic performance. Statement of the Hypothesis: H01: There is a significant impact between the use of AI on the academic performance and motivation of higher education students. H02: The use of AI-powered tools has no significant effect on the academic performance and motivation of higher education students. Significance of the Study This study on the impact of AI-powered study tools on the academic performance and motivation of higher education students is significant as AI-driven technologies continue to develop, their integration into educational practices necessitates comprehensive evaluation to determine their effectiveness and this research addresses a specific gap in understanding how AI tools influence not only academic performance but also students’ motivation towards learning.
