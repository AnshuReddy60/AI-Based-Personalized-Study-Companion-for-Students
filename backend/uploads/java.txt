variables are type of containers that are used to store values 

datatypes define the type of variables 
we have two types of data types- primitive and non primitive
Data Type	Description
byte	Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
short	Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
int	Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
long	Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
float	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
double	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 to 16 decimal digits
boolean	Stores true or false values
char	Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values

Non primitive datatypes are called reference types because they refer to objects.
Primitive types in Java are predefined and built into the language, while non-primitive types are created by the programmer (except for String).
Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, whereas primitive types cannot.

Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type.
In Java, there are two types of casting:
Widening Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double
Narrowing Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
Arithmetic operators Assignment operators Comparison operators Logical operators Bitwise operators
x=5 ++x -> 6, x++ -> 5

| Data Type | Method                   | Example Input                    |
| --------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `int`     | `nextInt()`              | `int age = sc.nextInt();`        |
| `float`   | `nextFloat()`            | `float f = sc.nextFloat();`      |
| `double`  | `nextDouble()`           | `double d = sc.nextDouble();`    |
| `String`  | `next()` → one word      | `String name = sc.next();`       |
| `String`  | `nextLine()` → full line | `String line = sc.nextLine();`   |
| `char`    | `sc.next().charAt(0)`    | `char ch = sc.next().charAt(0);` |
| `boolean` | `nextBoolean()`          | `boolean b = sc.nextBoolean();`  |

Java has the following conditional statements:

Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times until a condition is false.
